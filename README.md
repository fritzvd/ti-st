Collection of some stuff I use to read out the Sensortag. A what you ask? A [SensorTag](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag/?keyMatch=sensortag&tisearch=Search-EN-Everything&rec=true), is a device that bundles a few sensors for 30 USD. It can be read out through Bluetooth using BLE.

## getting started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fritzvd/ti-st.git
cd ti-st
npm install
npm run thermo
```

Nothing is documented at the moment, I'm sorry.
